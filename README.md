# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first real on-my-own project incorporating javascript,
html, and css all together, and getting them to cooperate with one another.

In retrospect, the code feels a little clunky and at times verbose, and I used a few workarounds that could have been accomplished more cleanly in the future (i.e. using a margin on the "VS" text that was in a flexbox to get it "centered"), but I am proud of what I was able to accomplish, and hope that with more practice I will be able to overcome these obstacles more easily in the future.

Things I need to improve on:
    - not using flexbox as often when it may not be necessary, and being able to indentify when another styling solution is better
    - truncating verbose code when possible, especially with regard to if-then statements
    - organizing CSS in a way that makes it more readable -- as of yet, I usually just have the CSS follow the divs down the page, but it seems like some people start with more generic element selectors, and move down to more specific selectors
    - observing and keeping track of what other websites look like, design-wise, so I can know what I like in the future
    - not creating DIVs that possibly don't need to exist

Things I learned or got better at:
    - using Event Listeners, specifically tranisitionend
    - using tranisition delays
    - adding "glow" effects to CSS
    - calling functions inside of other functions, instead of using one big, messy function to complete too many tasks

Thanks for all your help @Odin Project and @Wes Bos
